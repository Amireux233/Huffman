"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love! The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches."
¡ªDescription of Harry's deepest nature[src]
Harry James[60] Potter (b. 31 July 1980[1]) is a half-blood[2] wizard, and one of the most famous wizards of modern times. The only child and son of James and Lily Potter (n¨¦e Evans), both respected members of the original Order of the Phoenix, Harry's birth was overshadowed by a recently made prophecy naming either him or his future classmate Neville Longbottom the sole person to bring about Lord Voldemort's downfall, which was partially overheard by Lily's childhood best friend and then-Death Eater, Severus Snape. He spent a portion of his infancy hiding with his parents in Godric's Hollow, under a Fidelius Charm cast by Albus Dumbledore for their safety, only for their location to divulged their Secret-Keeper to Voldemort. In a vain attempt to circumvent the prophecy, murder his parents as they tried to protect him, but an led to Voldemort's first downfall, marking the end of the First Wizarding War and to Harry henceforth being known as the "Boy Who Lived."[5]

One consequence of Lily's loving sacrifice was that her orphaned son had to be raised by her only remaining blood relative, his Muggle aunt Petunia Dursley. While in her care he would be protected from Lord Voldemort, due to the Bond of Blood charm Albus Dumbledore placed upon him.[61] This powerful charm would protect him until he became of age, or no longer called his aunt's house home. As the only known survivor of the Killing Curse (up to that point), Harry was already famous before he arrived at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

The Dursley family were quite cruel to Harry growing up even forcing him to room in a broom closet and to wear their son Dudley's hand me downs. They did not treat Harry as a son as Dumbledore had hoped, but as a burden. They (unsuccessfully) tried to stamp every ounce of magic out of him.

On his eleventh birthday, Harry learned that he was a wizard.[62] He began attending Hogwarts in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House.[63] While at school, Harry became best friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and later became the youngest Quidditch Seeker in over a century and eventually the captain of his house's team, winning two Quidditch Cups.[64] He became even better known in his early years for protecting the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort, saving Ron's sister Ginny Weasley, solving the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, slaying Salazar Slytherin's basilisk, and learning how to conjure a corporeal stag Patronus at the age of thirteen. In his fourth year, Harry won the Triwizard Tournament, although the competition ended with the tragic death of Cedric Diggory and the return of Lord Voldemort. During the next school year, Harry reluctantly taught and led Dumbledore's Army. He also fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, during which he lost his godfather, Sirius Black.

Harry played a significant role in many other battles of the Second Wizarding War. He, Ron, and Hermione hunted down and destroyed Voldemort's Horcruxes. During the Battle of Hogwarts Harry personally saw the deaths of Severus Snape and Fred Weasley, and learned that Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Colin Creevey, and many others had fallen in battle as well. He encountered Voldemort and sacrificed himself, knowing that his doing so was the only way to destroy the fragment of Voldemort's soul inside him. In limbo, after Voldemort cursed him in the forest clearing, Albus Dumbledore gave Harry advice and background information on the Dark Lord. When told he could choose to live or to "move on", Harry chose to live. After he awoke he confronted Voldemort and defeated him once and for all. Harry was also notable for being the only known Master of Death, having united the three Deathly Hallows at the mere age of seventeen.

After the war, Harry became an Auror and helped reform and revolutionise the Ministry of Magic.[58] At some point, he married Ginny Weasley, with whom he had three children: James Sirius (named after his father and godfather), Albus Severus (named after Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape), and Lily Luna (named after his mother and Luna Lovegood). He was also named the godfather of Edward Remus Lupin. In 2007 Harry was promoted to Head of the Auror Office at the age of 26[65][57], and would occasionally deliver Defence Against the Dark Arts lectures at Hogwarts.[58] He later went on to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement by the summer of 2020.[59]
